 Dots and Boxes Game

Dots and Boxes is a classic pencil-and-paper game now implemented as a web-based application. This project allows users to play against an AI opponent with three difficulty levels.

## Features

- **Grid-Based Gameplay:** A dynamic 5x5 grid where players can draw lines and claim boxes.
- **AI Opponent:** Choose from three difficulty levels:
  - Easy: Random moves.
  - Medium: Moves with simple heuristics.
  - Hard: Advanced strategy (to be implemented).
- **Responsive Design:** Works on all screen sizes.

## How to Play

1. **Objective:** Complete boxes by drawing lines. The player who completes the most boxes wins.
2. **Turns:** Players take turns drawing lines between adjacent dots.
3. **AI:** After the player's move, the AI will automatically make its move.
4. **Winning:** The game ends when all boxes are claimed.
